	bool "Watchdog timer"

	default WATCHDOG_SUN6I_A31_WDT
	help
		The firmware is monitored by a watchdog timer. If an
		error occurs, the watchdog will reset the system instead
		of allowing it to hang.

		The watchdog also services user-requested system resets.

config WATCHDOG_SUN6I_A31_WDT
	bool "Watchdog (R_WDOG)"
	help
		This driver supports the watchdog in A31 and newer SoCs.

		This watchdog timer can reset the system after a minimum
		delay of one half second.

		Due to a bug in the H6 SoC, this watchdog timer hardware
		is used by other system software on that platform. When
		building for an H6 board, do not select this driver
		unless you know what you are doing.

config WATCHDOG_SUN9I_A80_TWD
	bool "Trusted watchdog (R_TWD)"
	depends on HAVE_R_TWD
	help
		This driver supports the trusted watchdog in A80 and
		newer SoCs.

		This watchdog timer can reset the system immediately.

		Older versions of Linux may interfere with this device,
		causing an unexpected reboot during system resume. As a
		workaround, select a different watchdog device.
